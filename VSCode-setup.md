# How to Setup VsCode

## Introduction

By default, VsCode is a good IDE, this guide will explain how a few extensions can make your life way easier

## Mandatory Extensions

### Prettier - Code Formatter

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter, we may not all aggree on their choices but the point is that it easily brings consistency to our coding style. **It is HIGHLY recommended to use Prettier.**

Look for the extensions called **Prettier - Code Formatter**, it will use ".editorconfig" if present for customization.

You can seup your editor so that files are automatically saved and prettier is automatically applied on save:

- Preferences / Settings => Search for "autosave". And select onFocusChange
- Preferences / Settings => Search for "autoindent". Enable the checkbox

### Live Share

Live Share is used to easily share screen remotely. We use it when paring remotely.

## Optional Extensions

Below are a list of extensions I found usefull (front end biased)

### Angular Extension Pack by Loiane Groner

There are 2 extensions called "Angular Extension Pack", they probably more or less do the same thing but the one I used is [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=loiane.angular-extension-pack)

One of the great thing it brings is the ability to "CMD + click" on a angular tag and it will open it's component file.

This also include auto-import

### vscode-icons

The icons on the file explorer are not that great (very opiniated point of view), install this extensions for a better look
